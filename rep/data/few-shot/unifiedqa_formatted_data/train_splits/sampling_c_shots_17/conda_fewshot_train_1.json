{"input": "if one wanted to move freight somewhere cheaply, would ir be a viable choice? \\n in the freight segment, ir ferries various commodities and fuels in industrial, consumer, and agricultural segments across the length and breadth of india. ir has historically subsidised the passenger segment with income from the freight business. as a result, freight services are unable to compete with other modes of transport on both cost and speed of delivery, leading to continuous erosion of market share. to counter this downward trend, ir has started new initiatives in freight segments including upgrading of existing goods sheds, attracting private capital to build multi-commodity multi-modal logistics terminals, changing container sizes, operating time-tabled freight trains, and tweaking with the freight pricing/product mix.", "answer": "NO"}

{"input": "can mosquito bites be actually avoided? \\n the primary method of controlling \"a. aegypti\" is by eliminating its habitats. this is done by getting rid of open sources of water, or if this is not possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. people accepting mosquito bites is the most effective way to eliminate the need to wear clothing that fully covers the skin, mosquito netting while resting and the application of deet insect repellent. while these measures can be an effective means of reducing an individual's risk of exposure, they do little in terms of mitigating the frequency of outbreaks, which appear to be on the rise in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of \"a. aegypti\". the range of the disease also appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.", "answer": "DON'T KNOW"}

{"input": "if a church had wanted to continue to perform this ritual, and to serve the lord's supper with freshly made bread in the year 2020 a.d., would a crippling shortage of yeast at the local grocery stores have been a hindrance to them? \\n adventist churches usually practice open communion four times a year. it commences with a foot washing ceremony, known as the \"ordinance of humility\", based on the gospel account of john 13. the ordinance of humility is meant to emulate christ's washing of his disciples' feet at the last supper and to remind participants of the need to humbly serve one another. participants segregate by gender to separate rooms to conduct this ritual, although some congregations allow married couples to perform the ordinance on each other and families are often encouraged to participate together. after its completion, participants return to the main sanctuary for consumption of the lord's supper, which consists of soft, risen bread loaves and unfermented grape juice.", "answer": "YES"}

{"input": "if a pilot flying an i-16 has an unsuccessful landing in a grassy field, is it likely that blood will start rushing to their head shortly after the crash? \\n initial service experience revealed that the shkas machine guns had a tendency to jam. this was the result of the guns being installed in the wings upside-down to facilitate the fit. the problem was addressed in later modifications. evaluations from pilots confirmed the experience with prototypes. controls were light and very sensitive, abrupt maneuvers resulted in spins, and spin behavior was excellent. an aileron roll could be performed in under 1.5 seconds (roll rate over 240 ;degrees/second). the machine guns were fired via a cable and the required effort, coupled with sensitive controls, made precision aiming difficult. the rear weight bias made the i-16 difficult to handle on unprepared airfields because the aircraft was rather likely to flip over the nose, especially if the front wheels dug in.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "was flamel against religious scholars? \\n nicolas flamel is a well-known alchemist, but a good example of pseudepigraphy, the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. although the historical flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612. flamel was a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher's stone. his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone. through the 14th and 15th centuries, alchemists were much like flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions. their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.", "answer": "NO"}

{"input": "from the way that this passage is written, if you saw a news report that claimed that an ironman triathlete had just broken the world record for \"all three events\", would you have to assume that the article was badly misprinted, and that the author meant to say that the total time was a new record? \\n buoyed by his defeat to guillemot, nurmi's races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously. previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. he aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in stockholm in 1921. in 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. a year later, nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile. his feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time was unprecedented in 1922, but has been matched since, and his tally of three concurrent official records has since been exceeded by runners and athletes in other sports. nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 finnish championships with a new national record. after excelling in mathematics, nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming olympic games.", "answer": "NO"}

{"input": "if you ask peter golden, did hunnic people live under a kind of rule halfway between a state and an empire? \\n hunnic governmental structure has long been debated. peter heather argues that the huns were a disorganized confederation in which leaders acted completely independently and that eventually established a ranking hierarchy, much like germanic societies. denis sinor similarly notes that, with the exception of the historically uncertain balamber, no hun leaders are named in the sources until uldin, indicating their relative unimportance. thompson argues that permanent kingship only developed with the huns invasion of europe and the near constant warfare that followed. regarding the organization of hunnic rule under attila, peter golden comments \"it can hardly be called a state or an empire\". golden speaks instead of a \"hunnic confederacy\". kim, however, argues that the huns were far more organized and centralized, with some basis in organization of the xiongnu state. walter pohl notes the correspondences of hunnic government to those of other steppe empires, but nevertheless argues that the huns do not appear to have been a unified group when they arrived in europe.", "answer": "NO"}
