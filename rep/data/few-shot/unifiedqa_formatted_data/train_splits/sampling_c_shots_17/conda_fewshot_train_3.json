{"input": "is it likely that the people who proposed the wey navigation were more competent than the people who made proposals for improving the mole? \\n the development of guildford (to the west) was stimulated by the construction of the wey navigation in the 1650s. in contrast, although several schemes were proposed to make the mole navigable, they stayed only as proposals and transport links to dorking remained poor. as a result, the local economy began to suffer and the town declined through the late 17th and early 18th centuries.", "answer": "DON'T KNOW"}
{"input": "would an environmentally concerned consumer choose apple as the best supplier of a product? \\n in 2010, climate counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts apple in their top category \"striding\". this was an increase from may 2008, when climate counts only gave apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company somewhat higher among all companies, at which time climate counts also labeled apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that apple at the time was \"the choice for the climate-conscious consumer\".", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "if someone wanted to travel from maine to machias seal island for a visit, would they need a passport to do so? \\n the british occupied the town of castine and most of eastern maine for the rest of the war, governing it under martial law and re-establishing the colony of new ireland. the treaty of ghent returned this territory to the united states. when the british left in april 1815, they took Â£10,750 in tariff duties from castine. this money, called the \"castine fund\", was used to establish dalhousie university in halifax. decisions about the islands in passamaquoddy bay were decided by joint commission in 1817. however, machias seal island was ruled to have been seized illegally by the british after the end of hostilities, and it was returned to the united states without further discussion. while kept by the us, it remains a point of contention for a few british idealists.", "answer": "NO"}

{"input": "if you asked a historian in the early 20th century if wilberforce and the clapham sect had played a large part in abolition, would they probably have said \"no?\" \\n as his sons had desired and planned, wilberforce has long been viewed as a christian hero, a statesman-saint held up as a role model for putting his faith into action. more broadly, he has also been described as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. in the 1940s, the role of wilberforce and the clapham sect in abolition stopped being downplayed, first by historian eric williams, who argued that abolition was motivated both by humanitarianism and by economics, as the west indian sugar industry was in decline. williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of the latter part of the 20th century. however, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of the abolition of the slave trade, and this has led to a renewed interest in wilberforce and the evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "without knowing the ending to the typical story, could you conclude that the narrator is working hard to get back and his feet, so to speak, and to return to his family as soon as he is financially able? \\n the critic edward champion notes that updike's prose heavily favors \"external sexual imagery\" rife with \"explicit anatomical detail\" rather than descriptions of \"internal emotion\" in descriptions of sex. in champion's interview with updike on \"the bat segundo show\", updike replied that he perhaps favored such imagery to concretize and make sex \"real\" in his prose. another sexual theme commonly addressed in updike is adultery, especially in a suburban, middle class setting, most famously in \"couples\" (1968). the updikean narrator is often \"a man guilty of infidelity and abandonment of his family\".", "answer": "NO"}
{"input": "was the new spain nobility a concept new to other parts of the americas? \\n the concept of nobility flourished in new spain in an unprecedented way in other parts of the americas. spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own. spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it. in the ensuing centuries, possession of a noble title in mexico did not mean one exercised great political power, for one's power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not. the concept of nobility in mexico was not political but rather a very conservative spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family. most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in new spain outside of the city itself, then spending the revenues in the capital, building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes. the craze to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. many of these palaces can still be seen today, leading to mexico city's nickname of \"the city of palaces\" given by alexander von humboldt.", "answer": "YES"}

{"input": "do old or used barrels use a type of wood that is restricted? \\n the base whiskies are distilled to between 180 and 190 proof which results in few congener by-products (such as fusel alcohol, aldehydes, esters, etc.) and creates a lighter taste. by comparison, an american whisky distilled any higher than 160 proof is labelled as \"light whiskey\". the flavouring whiskies are distilled to a lower proof so that they retain more of the grain's flavour. the relative lightness created by the use of base whiskies makes canadian whisky useful for mixing into cocktails and highballs. the minimum three year aging in small wood barrels applies to all whiskies used in the blend. as the regulations do not limit the specific type of wood that must be used, a variety of flavours can be achieved by blending whiskies aged in different types of barrels. in addition to new wood barrels, charred or uncharred, flavour can be added by aging whiskies in previously used bourbon or fortified wine barrels for different lengths of time.", "answer": "DON'T KNOW"}
{"input": "do pure intentions mean a harmful act should be forgiven? \\n another consequentialist version is motive consequentialism, which looks at whether the state of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better or at least as good as each of the alternative state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. this version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. an act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. a possible inference is, that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgments if the motivation was to do good.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "would an ancient roman builder likely use concrete to complete a building after the interior was finished? \\n the greeks used volcanic tuff from the island of thera as their pozzolan and the romans used crushed volcanic ash (activated aluminium silicates) with lime. this mixture could set under water, increasing its resistance to corrosion like rust. the material was called \"pozzolana\" from the town of pozzuoli, west of naples where volcanic ash was extracted. in the absence of pozzolanic ash, the romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near rome. the huge dome of the pantheon in rome and the massive baths of caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes, many of which still stand. the vast system of roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement. roman concrete was often used on the outside of buildings. the normal technique was to use brick facing material as the formwork for an infill of mortar mixed with an aggregate of broken pieces of stone, brick, potsherds, recycled chunks of concrete, or other building rubble.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "did air france f-btsd have blue wings during their pepsi promotional campaign? \\n concorde had livery restrictions; the majority of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at mach 2. the white finish reduced the skin temperature by. in 1996, air france briefly painted f-btsd in a predominantly blue livery and wings with the exception of a promotional deal with pepsi. in this paint scheme, air france was advised to remain at for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under mach 1.7. f-btsd was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended mach 2 operations.", "answer": "DON'T KNOW"}

{"input": "could you make a reasonable conclusion that the potential defectors and the political prisoners that gaddafi released themselves became charismatic agitators, once they were free to speak to the public openly? \\n following the start of the arab spring in 2011, gaddafi spoke out in favour of tunisian president zine el abidine ben ali, then threatened by the tunisian revolution. he suggested that tunisia's people would be satisfied if ben ali introduced a \"jamahiriyah\" system there. fearing domestic protest, libya's government implemented preventive measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors, and releasing several islamist prisoners. this seemed to be a wise decision at the time, as on 17 february 2011, while major protests broke out in nearby countries, there was no noticeable protest against gaddafi's government. unlike tunisia or egypt, libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30 per cent.", "answer": "NO"}
