{"answer": "DON'T KNOW", "input": "is grifo remembered for any failure in his life? \\n tassilo iii (b. 741 – d. after 796)succeeded his father at the age of eight only after grifo's successful rule of bavaria. he initially ruled under frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onward. he was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, fighting slavs in the eastern alps and along the danube and colonizing these lands. after 781, however, his cousin charlemagne began to pressure tassilo to submit and finally deposed him in 788. the deposition was not entirely legitimate. dissenters attempted a coup against charlemagne at tassilo's old capital of regensburg in 792, led by his own son pépin the hunchback. the king had to drag tassilo out of imprisonment to formally renounce his rights and titles at the assembly of frankfurt in 794. this is the last appearance of tassilo in the sources, and he probably died a monk. as all of his family were also forced into monasteries, this was the end of the agilolfing dynasty."}
{"answer": "YES", "input": "is there any historical account of kallinikos origin from heliopolis in egypt? \\n the accuracy and exact chronology of this account is open to question: elsewhere, theophanes reports the use of fire-carrying ships equipped with nozzles (\"siphōn\") by the byzantines a couple of years before the supposed arrival of kallinikos at constantinople. if this is not due to chronological confusion of the events of the siege, it may suggest that kallinikos merely introduced an improved version of an established weapon. the historian james partington further thinks it likely that greek fire was not in fact the creation of any single person but \"invented by chemists in constantinople who had inherited the discoveries of the alexandrian chemical school.\" indeed, the 11th-century chronicler george kedrenos records that kallinikos came from heliopolis in egypt, but most scholars reject this as an error. kedrenos also records the story, considered rather implausible by modern scholars, that kallinikos' descendants, a family called \"lampros\", \"brilliant,\" kept the secret of the fire's manufacture and continued doing so to kedrenos' time."}

{"answer": "NO", "input": "if someone is using an infrared camera to look at an object but has determined its emissivity incorrectly, will the camera probably give a true reading of the object's temperature? \\n the concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects. this is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the idea of a black body. to further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature may not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. for example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler (assuming, as is often the case, that the surrounding environment is cooler than the objects being viewed). when an object has less than perfect emissivity, it obtains properties of reflectivity and/or transparency, and so the temperature of the surrounding environment is partially reflected by and/or transmitted through the object. if the object were in a hotter environment, then a lower emissivity object at the same temperature would likely appear to be hotter than a more emissive one. for that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity and not accounting for environmental temperatures will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers."}
