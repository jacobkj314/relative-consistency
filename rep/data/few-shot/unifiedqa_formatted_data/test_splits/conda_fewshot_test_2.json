{"answer": "YES", "input": "do palm populations with large ranges decrease after significant habitat changes? \\n like many other plants, palms have been threatened by human intervention and exploitation. the greatest risk to palms is destruction of habitat, especially in the tropical forests, due to urbanization, wood-chipping, mining, and conversion to farmland. palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them. the harvesting of heart of palm, a delicacy in salads, also poses a threat because it is derived from the palm's apical meristem, a vital part of the palm that cannot be regrown (except in domesticated varieties, e.g. of peach palm). the use of rattan palms in furniture has caused a major population decrease in these species that has negatively affected local and international markets, as well as biodiversity in the area. the sale of seeds to nurseries and collectors is another threat, as the seeds of popular palms are sometimes harvested directly from the wild. in 2006, at least 100 palm species were considered endangered, and nine species have been reported as recently extinct."}
