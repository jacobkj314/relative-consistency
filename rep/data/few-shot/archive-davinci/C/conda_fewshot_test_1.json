Though German fighter presence over Normandy increased over the next days and weeks, it never approached the numbers the Allies commanded. Fighter-bomber attacks on German formations made movement during daylight almost impossible. Subsequently, shortages soon developed in food, fuel and ammunition, severely hampering the German defenders.

Under these conditions it was difficult for German commanders to employ the \"armoured idea\", if at all.", "sentence2": "If you were to include long-range bombing missions, regular weather reconnaissance flights, and any of other sundry missions that would be occurring in the same area as the D-day landings, would the total number of allied sorties that this passage refers to actually be a larger number on D-day?", "label": "NO"}

While the murder of Jewish civilians had been ongoing in the occupied territories of Poland and the Soviet Union, plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest would be killed in the implementation of the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. Initially the victims were killed by \"Einsatzgruppen\" firing squads, then by stationary gas chambers or by gas vans, and these methods proved practical for an operation of this scale. By 1942 extermination camps equipped with gas chambers were established at Auschwitz, Chełmno, Sobibor, Treblinka, and elsewhere.
