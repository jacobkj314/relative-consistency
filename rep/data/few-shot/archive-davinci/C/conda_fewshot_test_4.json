They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. Espen J. Aarseth argues that games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, and these aspects are vital to gameplay. For example, Aarseth understands the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game \"Tomb Raider\", saying that \"the dimensions of Lara Croft's body, already analyzed to death by film theorists, are energizing to me as a player, because a different-looking body would make me play differently... When I play, I see her body, but also see through it and past it.\" Simply put, ludologists embrace traditional theories of art, but they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.", "sentence2": "Does a ludologist think they would do as well in Tomb Raider if Lara Croft were replaced with a gray box with legs?", "label": "NO"}
