Her mother, Gladys Pearl Baker, was from a poor Midwestern family who had migrated to California at the turn of the century. At the age of 15, she married John Newton Baker, an abusive man nine years her senior. They had two children named Robert (1917–1933) and Berniece (b. 1919). She successfully filed for divorce and sole custody in 1923, but Baker kidnapped the children soon after and moved with them to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was 12, and met Berniece for the first time as an adult. Following the divorce, Gladys worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. In 1924, she married Martin Edward Mortensen, but they separated only some months later and divorced in 1928. The identity of Monroe's father was unknown to her throughout her life, and could not even be definitively specified by her mother, so Monroe herself most often used Baker as her surname.", "sentence2": "Even if she and her mother both took the name to their respective graves, does it sound like Norma Jean Mortenson knew in her adulthood, without doubt, who her true father was?", "label": "NO"}
