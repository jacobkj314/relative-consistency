{"input": "Passage: Costs of disability pensions are steadily growing in Western countries, mainly in Europe and the United States. It was reported that, in the UK, expenditure on disability pensions accounted for 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980; two decades later it had reached 2.6% of GDP. A link between increased time away from work due to illness and an increased risk of the need for a disability pension later in life has been reported in several studies.\\nQuestion: Does it sound like employers may worry about an employee who takes sick days, because these short illnesses could be leading up to a more serious issue down the line, which could result in the loss of an employee?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "Passage: The ancient Mesopotamians also performed magical rituals to purify themselves of sins committed unknowingly. One such ritual was known as the Šurpu, or \"Burning\", in which the caster of the spell would transfer the guilt for all their misdeeds onto various objects such as a strip of dates, an onion, and a tuft of wool. The person would then burn the objects and thereby purify themself of all sins that they might have unknowingly committed. A whole genre of love spells existed. Such spells were believed to cause a person to fall in love with another person, restore love which had faded, or cause a male sexual partner to be unable to sustain an erection when he had previously been virile. Other spells were used to reconcile a man with his patron deity or to reconcile a wife with a husband who had been neglecting her.\\nQuestion: Does the spell affecting men's sexual experiences prevent them from having sex?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "Passage: At the outbreak of the American Civil War, \"Opothleyahola\" refused to form an alliance with the Confederacy, unlike many other tribes, including many of the Lower Creeks. Runaway slaves, free blacks, Chickasaw and Seminole Indians began gathering at Opothleyahola's plantation, where they hoped to remain neutral in the conflict between the North and South. On August 15, 1861, Opothleyahola and tribal chief \"Micco Hutko\" contacted President Abraham Lincoln to request help for the Union loyalists. On September 10, they received a positive response, stating the United States government would assist them. The letter directed Opothleyahola to move his people to Fort Row in Wilson County, Kansas, where they would receive asylum and aid. They became known as Loyalists, and many were members of the traditional Snake band in the latter part of the century.\\nQuestion: Might the Confederacy have counted on all the Lower Creek tribes to help them in their fighting?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "DON'T KNOW"}
{"input": "Passage: The fears of Wilson and other government officials were confirmed when Galleanists—Italian immigrant followers of the anarchist Luigi Galleani—carried out a series of bombings in April and June 1919. At the end of April, some 30 Galleanist letter bombs had been mailed to a host of individuals, mostly prominent government officials and businessmen, but also law enforcement officials. Only a few reached their targets, but all exploded when opened. Some people suffered injuries, including a housekeeper in Senator Thomas W. Hardwick's residence, who had her hands blown off. On June 2, 1919, the second wave of bombings occurred, when several much larger package bombs were detonated by Galleanists in eight American cities, including one that damaged the home of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer in Washington, D.C. At least one person was killed in this second attack, night watchman William Boehner, and fears were raised because it occurred in the capital. Flyers declaring war on capitalists in the name of anarchist principles accompanied each bomb.\\nQuestion: Were the bombs used in the first wave of attacks likely made by competent bomb makers?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "Passage: Diplomatic missions between members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are not called embassies, but high commissions, for Commonwealth nations share a special diplomatic relationship. It is generally expected that an embassy of a Commonwealth country in a non-Commonwealth country will do its best to provide diplomatic services to citizens from other Commonwealth countries if the citizen's country does not have an embassy in that country. Canadian and Australian nationals enjoy even greater cooperation between their respective consular services, as outlined in the Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement. The same kind of procedure is also followed multilaterally by the member states of the European Union (EU). European citizens in need of consular help in a country with an absence of diplomatic or consular representation of their own country may turn to any consular or diplomatic mission of another EU member state.\\nQuestion: If a German citizen loses their passport in a country that has no German diplomatic or consulate, can they go to a French consulate to get a new passport?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "Passage: Before the Roman invasion Caratacus is associated with the expansion of his tribe's territory. His apparent success led to Roman invasion, nominally in support of his defeated enemies. He resisted the Romans for almost a decade, mixing guerrilla warfare with set-piece battles, and was successful in the latter. After his final victory he fled to the territory of Queen Cartimandua, who captured him and handed him over to the Romans. He was sentenced to death as a military prisoner, but made a speech before his execution that persuaded the Emperor Claudius to spare him.\\nQuestion: Would opposing generals facing Caratacus in a set-piece battle have felt confident before the fight?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "NO"}
{"input": "Passage: Senior Greek military officers then withdrew their support from the junta, which collapsed. Constantine Karamanlis returned from exile in France to establish a government of national unity until elections could be held. Karamanlis worked to defuse the risk of war with Turkey and also legalised the Communist Party, which had been criminal since 1947. His newly organized party, New Democracy (ND), won the elections held in November 1974 by a wide margin, and he became prime minister.\\nQuestion: Was a Communist politician likely to run for office in 1948?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "NO"}
{"input": "Passage: Baku has a temperate semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: \"BSk\") with hot and humid summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, in contrast to many other cities with such climate features, Baku does not see extremely hot summers and substantial sunshine hours. This is largely because of its northerly latitude and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea. Baku, and the Absheron Peninsula on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan (precipitation here is around or less than a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons is particularly wet.\\nQuestion: Would a person who enjoys sunbathing and getting a deep tan be likely to choose to a city with a temperate semi-arid climate for their summer vacation?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "YES"}
{"input": "Passage: In 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\". This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company somewhat higher among all companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"the choice for the climate-conscious consumer\".\\nQuestion: Was Apple's score in the Climate Counts' ranking bad among tech companies?\\nGive the rationale before answering.", "answer": "NO"}
