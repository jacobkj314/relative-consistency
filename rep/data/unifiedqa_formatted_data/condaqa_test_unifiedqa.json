{"input": "if a drug addict is caught with marijuana, is there a chance he will be jailed? \\n drug possession is the crime of having one or more illegal drugs in one's possession, either for personal use, distribution, sale or otherwise. illegal drugs fall into different categories and sentences vary depending on the amount, type of drug, circumstances, and jurisdiction. in the u.s., the penalty for illegal drug possession and sale can vary from a small fine to a prison sentence. in some states, marijuana possession is considered to be a petty offense, with the penalty being comparable to that of a speeding violation. in some municipalities, possessing a small quantity of marijuana in one's own home is not punishable at all. generally, however, drug possession is an arrestable offense, although first-time offenders rarely serve jail time. federal law makes even possession of \"soft drugs\", such as cannabis, illegal, though some local governments have laws contradicting federal laws.", "answer": "YES"}
